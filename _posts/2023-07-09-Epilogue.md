# Epilogue
## The Aftermath

The motley crew of adventurers - Tom, Druix, Dopric, Itila, Damian, Puk, Valeros, and of course, Corvo the raven - stumbled out of the cavern into the welcoming embrace of daylight. They were a sight to behold, an almost artistic display of cuts, bruises, and mud that seemed to come alive under the sunlight.

"Is it just me," Tom squinted into the sunshine, "or does the sun seem particularly *nosey* today?"

"Could be your head wound," Dopric suggested helpfully, "or perhaps the sun is just glad to see you're still a part of the mortal realm. Word on the astral plane was that Bolbau had you cornered."

Tom gave him a look. "Astral plane gossip, now?"

Druix, ever the pragmatic goblin alchemist, rummaged through his bag. "Healing potions, anyone? I seem to have an excess, and since we've concluded our bout of near-death experiences..."

As they began their trek back, they were joined by a disconcertingly large flock of birds that seemed to have taken an interest in Corvo. The raven maintained a dignified silence, perched on Tom's shoulder, but occasionally made strange gestures at the other birds with its wings. Damian, the human cleric, said a prayer of thanks to Aman for their survival. Itila, the dark elf monk, remained silent, her calm demeanor undisturbed even by the all-too-lively company.

Their journey took them back to the city, a bustling mosaic of noise, dirt, and life. It was a welcoming sight for the bruised and battered crew - although Tom did comment that the city looked like it had gone through a child's sketching phase, with all its odd angles and haphazard placement of buildings.

"Perhaps," mused Valeros, the human fighter, "it's a metaphor for us. We're all a little skewed, aren't we? Yet somehow, together, we make up something...coherent. In a peculiar way."

"Metaphors now, are we?" Dopric teased. "This close to dying has certainly made you philosophical."

As they made their way through the familiar streets of the city, the adventurers garnered curious looks from the passersby - but then, people of their sort always did.

Soon, the austere, arcane architecture of Dr. Strange's office loomed before them. In true form, it was the only building that dared to tower over the others, an odd mix of imposing and inviting.

"Well, well," Tom grinned, "Dr. Strange is going to have a field day with our adventure tales."

Inside, the office was filled with the scent of old parchment, obscure incense, and the inexplicable smell of freshly baked bread - a scent that seemed to have gotten permanently lodged into the floorboards. And at the center of the cosmic whirlwind of clutter and questionable interior design sat Dr. Strange.

"Ah," he looked up from an unfathomably thick book, "I see you've decided to come back from your little field trip."

"Wouldn't miss our debriefing for all the tea in the world," Tom replied, winking at the others. After all, the aftermath had only just begun.

## The Debriefing

"Tell me everything," Dr. Strange said, steepling his fingers and leaning back in his chair. His eyes sparkled with a mix of concern and curiosity, like a cat that had spotted a particularly interesting beetle.

And so, they did.

Tom, Druix, and Dopric recounted their battles against Gandolf, Gomlo, Orogourn and their allies. They detailed their struggles and the narrow escapes, their eventual victories and the relief that came with it. The room was filled with a mixture of triumph and exhaustion as they spoke of their allies who had been sent elsewhere in the cave, fighting their own battles. Itila's serene martial prowess, Valeros's unwavering bravery, Damian's unyielding faith, and Puk's nimble quickness were all remembered and honored in their recounting.

Dr. Strange listened with rapt attention, occasionally nodding or interjecting with a question. When they finished, he let out a low whistle. "Quite the tale, isn't it? You've all done exceptionally well."

Their visit to the Commander was a more formal affair. Dressed in his immaculate uniform, the Commander listened to their report with a stern expression. The mission had not been a simple one, and the political implications were vast. They had thwarted a significant attack on the city, and in doing so, they had disrupted the power dynamics. The Commander assured them that he would handle the fallout, but there were concerns and consequences that needed to be addressed.

And so, the heroes returned to their lodgings, where the city healers attended to their injuries. Bruises were treated, cuts were stitched, and magical salves were applied to the more severe wounds. Exhaustion eventually overcame them, and they fell into a deep sleep, their dreams filled with the echoes of battle and victory.

For the moment, they had peace. Their adventure was over - until the next one began.

## Cheers and Tears 

The news of the victory was announced city-wide, carried along the streets by heralds and amplified by magical public announcement spheres (a recent invention of the university's Artificer Department, not without its kinks). It was a public display of gratitude that swept the city in an all-encompassing wave of relief and joy. The heroes - their heroes - had succeeded.

Dr. Strange and the Commander took time to offer their personal congratulations. Dr. Strange, usually a man of few words when it came to sentiments, shook each of their hands in turn, a genuine smile touching his eyes. "You've made me very proud," he said, his voice barely above a whisper.

The Commander, his stiff exterior softened by the victory, clapped each hero on the shoulder. "You've done well," he said, his voice carrying a hint of warmth that was often absent in their previous interactions.

And then, in the midst of the celebrations, a solemn note rang out. A pause, a moment to remember those who had fallen, those who had been injured in the attacks on the university. The heroes stood silently, their heads bowed as they remembered their fallen comrades.

Because that was the thing about victory. It was often bittersweet, a mix of joy and sorrow. But then, as the city healer had once wisely said, "If it were easy, it wouldn't be a victory. It'd just be a walk in the park."

And really, where was the fun in that?

## The Banquet’s a Brewin’

The city was abuzz like a beehive, albeit a very festive one. The University's horticulture department had taken to decorating the city square with an explosion of magical foliage that shimmered under the evening light. The local innkeepers had set up stalls serving their signature dishes, whilst street performers entertained the swelling crowd with their dazzling acts. The atmosphere was electric, a tangible testament to the city's collective relief and happiness.

The heroes, no longer sporting their battle-worn gear, had cleaned up quite nicely. Druix was in a suit of forest green, the color echoing his goblin heritage. Tom was in a set of traditional wizard's robes, much to everyone's amusement, whilst Dopric was in a svelte ensemble of black and silver, his gnome's cap perched jauntily on his head. They might have been taken for very reputable (and only slightly mischievous) citizens if it weren’t for the knowing glances and whispers that followed them.

Dr. Strange and the Commander made their entrance, with the city-folk parting before them like a living sea. Dr. Strange, usually shrouded in an air of arcane mystery, had swapped his somber wizard robes for a less cryptic (but equally elegant) dress suit. The Commander, though, was every bit the military man, his uniform pressed to perfection, medals glinting in the soft light.

Other notable figures arrived: The Guildmaster, surprisingly less frosty than usual; the Artificer-in-Chief, looking vaguely preoccupied and muttering about calibrations; the University Chancellor, visibly relieved that his beloved institution was no longer under threat.

It was, all in all, shaping up to be a banquet that would be talked about for ages - and knowing this city, that was saying something.

## The Oration's a Rantin’ and the Merriment’s a Comin’

If there was one thing that wizards and commanders had in common (apart from the tendency to have things explode around them), it was their love for speeches. And so, Dr. Strange, who had never met a podium he didn't like, opened his mouth and let the words fly out, accompanied by the occasional spark of magic that made the listeners' ears tingle.

Dr. Strange lauded the heroes' bravery, their quick thinking, and their "almost obsessive passion for mischief," as he put it. His gaze lingered a bit longer on Tom at that last point, but of course, that might have just been a trick of the light. His speech was punctuated with magical effects that turned his words into dancing lights, dazzling the crowd.

The Commander's speech was a far more grounded affair, though not without its own special effects. Each praise was punctuated by a stomp of his boots, causing the ground to rumble slightly, as if in agreement. He mentioned each hero by name, detailing their feats in the battles. When he got to Dopric, he frowned, adding, "and an uncanny ability to use mundane objects as deadly weapons. I'll never look at a serving spoon the same way again."

The crowd erupted into applause, and the heroes were summoned to the stage. There were medals, handshakes, and a couple of manly half-hugs from the Commander that were powerful enough to crack ribs. But the city, being an old hand at festivities, knew that it was just the overture. The real party was about to begin.

And begin it did, with the kind of energy and enthusiasm usually reserved for finding forgotten money in an old pair of trousers. Tables groaned under the weight of food and drink, stories were exchanged, retold, and embellished, until the line between fact and fiction was more blurred than a sasquatch caught in a heavy fog.

The crowd, heroes included, laughed, ate, and danced with such gusto that if happiness was a renewable energy source, they could have powered the city for years. And if the world outside these walls dared to peek in, it might have seen not a city that had barely escaped destruction, but a place where joy was the rule of law, and the only enemy they recognized was a dwindling mug of ale.

But remember, dear reader, that while this is all happening, somewhere in the multiverse, an entity is taking notes, chuckling at the antics of the silly little humans. After all, where would the multiverse be without the comedy of mortal life? 

Oh, what? You thought you were the only one reading this? Sorry to break it to you, but you're not alone in peeking into other people's universes. It's quite the pastime, really. You might give it a try sometime.

## To The Reflective Pond of Memory We Stroll

Druix, between mouthfuls of exotic alchemical-infused drinks that fizzed and popped as they changed colors, found himself pondering his growth. From a simple goblin with a penchant for potions, he had transformed into a battlefield sage, defying the societal image of goblins as savage nuisances. He felt the edges of his intellect and creativity expand, pushing the boundaries of what he thought he could do. The future shimmered with the promise of unexplored alchemical reactions. 

Valeros, with a leg perched on a chair and a mug of ale in hand, was the picture of contentment. He mused on his journey, how he had stood against daunting odds, held his ground, and delivered blows that sang tales of victory. His sword arm felt stronger, his heart more resilient, his spirit buoyed by the camaraderie of his fellow warriors. He looked forward to more fights, more victories, more stories etched in the annals of time.

Tom, quietly nursing a glass of wine, was lost in thought. He marveled at his growth, at the unexpected thrill of this adventure that redefined his perception of the world. The grey areas of morality he had explored, the risk he took in leading the party, his fascination with his burgeoning magical prowess - all seemed to fuel a yearning for more. More knowledge, more risk, more magic. The adventure had ended, but for Tom, it was just the beginning.

Dopric, engaged in an animated conversation with an enchanted piece of cutlery, reflected on his growth. The gnome who once used sleight of hand to pilfer shiny objects had transformed into a formidable thaumaturge who could manipulate reality with illusions. His future looked bright, sprinkled with potential new tricks up his sleeve and perhaps, more enchanted cutlery to converse with.

As for the others - Damian, Itila, and Puk - they too had their quiet moments of reflection, even amidst the clamor of the banquet. Each had their tales of growth and victory, their dreams for the future, their hope ignited by the success of their mission.

Meanwhile, across the banquet hall, Dr. Strange and the Commander stood deep in conversation, their faces drawn with the weight of their words. They reflected on the ordeal, the heroic efforts of the party, the risks they had faced, and the victory they had achieved. They debated the implications, the future of the city, and the lessons they could draw from this adventure.

The Commander, practical and forward-looking, spoke of preparedness and strength. Dr. Strange, with his wisdom rooted in the arcane, spoke of resilience and the power of unity. Their conversation flowed, brimming with lessons and predictions, their words weaving a tapestry of a hopeful future for the city.

## The Discarding of Fizzing Streamers and Unfulfilled Dance Cards

And thus, like a really good party that finally winds down when the last of the cheese has been eaten and the final note of music has died down, the grand banquet drew to its close. The heroes exchanged warm handshakes, hearty back-slaps, and a few misty-eyed hugs with Dr. Strange and the Commander. The latter, rather surprisingly, even managed a brief and somewhat stiff jig with Dopric, who later swore he saw a twinkle of merriment in the Commander's stern eyes.

The heroes then turned to each other, their words heavy with farewells yet lightened with the promise of future adventures. Tom raised a toast, his voice wavering with uncharacteristic sentimentality, "To friends, to victory, to future capers!"

They each set off on their individual paths as the sun began to tinge the sky with shades of dawn. Itila slipped into the shadows, a flicker of movement barely discernible in the weak morning light. Dopric hopped onto a cart pulled by a bored-looking mule, tossing a few sparkling fireworks behind him. Damian, solemn as always, walked away with a new sense of purpose in his step. Druix disappeared amidst a puff of colorful smoke, leaving behind a lingering scent of roses and goblin sweat. Puk dashed off into the crowd, jingling with stolen cutlery. Valeros strolled away, his confident gait interrupted by an occasional hiccup. Tom, meanwhile, hovered a few feet above the ground, wobbling uncertainly on a makeshift magical broom.

The city, once again wrapped in tranquility, heaved a sigh of relief. The air, tinged with the joyous remnants of the celebration and the faint scent of victory, hummed with newfound respect and admiration for the band of heroes.

As the city came alive with the buzz of a new day, our tale of valor and friendship, of threats vanquished and heroes made, drew to a close. But fear not, dear reader, for in the world of adventure and magic, the end is but the start of a new journey.

This is where we'd place 'The End' if we were to be formal about it, but since we've been in such close quarters for the duration, let's just say 'Till the next adventure, cheers!' and we can all pretend that we are not in the slightest bit teary-eyed about it.
